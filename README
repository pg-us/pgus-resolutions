PGUS Resolutions
================

All resolutions that have ever been proposed are in the doc directory.

An example in YAML is example.yaml.

A script that uses python and sqlite3 to build a SQL database of the
resolutions is in scripts/create-db.py.  Run it from the root directory.

Using sqlite
------------

Run the following command to build the sqlite3 database:

    scripts/create-db.py

Run the following command to list all the resolutions and page it into less:

    sqlite3 -line pgus "select id, action, title, resolution from resolutions order by id" | less
