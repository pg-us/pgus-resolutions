    WHEREAS:
    
            1.  The NYC PostgreSQL User Group (NYCPUG) is supporting the annual
                NYC Tech Gala, which brings together the local technology user
                groups (e.g. New York Linux User Group) for an annual holiday
                party, wishes to provide a place to collect funds for the NYC Tech
                Gala and pay as a nonprofit organization.
    
    The United States PostgreSQL Association resolves that
    
            1.  All money collected specifically for the NYC Tech Event will not
                be subject to the 5% collection fee that NYCPUG provides to PgUS
