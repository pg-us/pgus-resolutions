resolution: |
    [JD]A User group can request support from PGUS but we do not govern them in
    any way. We can of course dictate how our support is used (no, we won't
    give you money for a party with a talking donkey but yes we will
    sponsor your SFPUG anniversary so you can provide food).
    
    A user can request sponsorship for items such as travel as long as the
    purpose of the travel is within the guidelines of our mission/bylaws.
    
    The conference series is an autonomous project being supported by PGUS.
