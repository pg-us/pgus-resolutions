    [JD] Once we have a defined membership of at least 100 I would like
    to negotiate with:
    
     ACM for a discounted membership
     ANSI for a discounted membership
    
    We could also offer a significantly reduced book purchase program. We
    wouldn't be able to beat Amazon but people may be willing to purchase
    from us for the sake of purchasing from us instead of Amazon.
    
    E.g; by becoming a member of US PostgreSQL you qualify for discounts
    to these sister organizations
