    WHEREAS
    
    United States PostgreSQL Association (PgUS) wishes to properly address the
    free lifetime memberships that were in place now that the corporation can
    process memberships.
    
    Resolution 29 granting individuals membership to PGUS was passed at a time
    whereas the corporation had no members.
    
    The United States PostgreSQL Association resolves that:
    
    1. Resolution 29 is hereby revoked, with the understanding that members who
       were granted lifetime membership under resolution 29 prior to June 1,
       2017, are “grandfathered” in and retain their lifetime member status,
       provided that they annually reconfirm their interest in retaining
       membership.
