    Exhibit A

    CODE OF CONDUCT

    The United States PostgreSQL Association (PgUS) is dedicated to providing a
    harassment-free experience for everyone.

    We do not tolerate harassment of PgUS members in any form. Sexual language
    and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including exhibition booths,
    talks and social events around PgUS. Members violating these rules may be
    sanctioned or expelled from the corporation without a refund at the
    discretion of the PgUS board of directors or members.

    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
    orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
    displaying sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
    stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
    disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
    unwelcome sexual attention.  Participants asked to stop any harassing
    behavior are expected to comply immediately.

    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the PgUS board of directors
    or members may take any action they deem appropriate, including ejection
    from the corporation with no refund. If you feel that you are being
    harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
    concerns, please contact a PgUS board member immediately.

    Thank you for your help in making PgUS fun and enjoyable for everyone!
