    WHEREAS

    1. The corporation wishes to reduce the unecessary requirement of where
       funds may be transfered when an Associated Project separates from the
       corporation after a tax attorney had reviewed the related clauses as
       they were with respect to the impact of the corporation's tax status
       with Oregon law.

    THE UNITED STATES POSTGRESQL ASSOCIATION RESOLVES THAT

    1. Amend Clause 3.2.2.1 "Request a transfer of funds to another 501c3" to
       "Request a transfer of funds to another account minus any incurred fees
       and estimated taxes determined by the corporation accountant."

    2. Amend Clause 4.3.3.1 "Request a transfer of funds to another 501c3" to
       "Request a transfer of funds to another account minus any incurred feeds
       and estimated taxes determined by the corporation accountant."
