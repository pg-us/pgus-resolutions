    WHEREAS:
    
      The corporation bylaws need to be updated to reflect how officer elections
      have been run the past two cycles.
    
    THE UNITED STATES POSTGRESQL ASSOCIATION RESOLVES THAT:
    
      1. "Article IV Section 1. Officers" will be split into two separate sections,
      for clarity, to "Section 1. Officers" and "Section 2.  Nomination and
      election."  Section numbers are subject to change with final legal review):
    
    	Article IV Section 1 is simply reduced to:
                                                                                                                                              	 
        	The Officers of the Corporation shall be a President, a Secretary and a
        	Treasurer.
    
      2.  "Article Iv Section 2. Nomination and election."  will be added to clarify
      and reflect how elections have run and will continue to run most recently
      operating.  One correction is to reword the Officer terms from two years to
      one year terms.  The other point of clarity is to be more specific that the
      officer elections are to be held after new board members take their seat,
      as opposed to when the annual meeting is to be held.
    
    	Each Officer shall be elected annually by the Board after its March
    	meeting from among the Directors when newly elected Board members take
    	their seat. All officers must be directors of this corporation, and all
    	directors may nominate candidates for officers of this corporation. All
    	directors then in office may vote on candidates for such offices.  Such
    	offices shall be filled in an election upon the vote of a majority of
    	directors then in office. Each Officer shall serve for a term of one (1)
    	year. Officers shall assume their respective duties immediately upon
    	election.  The Board may, by resolution, establish procedures governing
    	nomination and election of officers that are consistent with these
    	Bylaws.
